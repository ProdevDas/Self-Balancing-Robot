# Self-Balancing-Robot
As the name suggests, the self-balancing robot is an automated vehicle that balances itself without any outside help or support. Even if the robot is displaced from its position, it is programmed so that it again recovers its position.

Introduction:
The search for balance in the dynamic field of robotics has given rise to an interesting concept called the Self-Balancing Robot. Inspired by the goal of building a self-balancing robot, this project combines the ease of use of Arduino, the accuracy of an Infrared (IR) sensor, and the ease of construction.
At its foundation, Arduino offers a user-friendly platform for control and programming. The robot can detect changes in its orientation with respect to the ground thanks to the IR sensor, which serves as its watchful eyes. This project stands out for its simplicity; it demonstrates how a deliberate combination can be used to accomplish a difficult task like balancing.
